A booking can be used to schedule usage of a room or a piece of equipment.
You can also set up a booking for a meeting or other on-off events.
Most bookings will be associated with an item (room or equipment), but
you can have bookings that are not tied to any items. The advantage of
connecting a booking to a room is that other users (teachers) will
be able to see your reservations. Thus you can set up a booking
system for rooms at a school or beamers and other equipment.
