<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><b>Simple Dictionary</b>:</dt>
<dd>looks like a conventional dictionary with separate entries. No authors are displayed and attachments are shown as links.</dd>
<dt><b>Continuous</b>:</dt>
<dd>shows the entries one after other without any kind of separation but the editing icons.</dd>
<dt><b>Full with Author</b>:</dt>
<dd>A forum-like display format showing author's data. Attachments are shown as links.</dd>
<dt><b>Full without Author</b>:</dt>
<dd>A forum-like display format that does not show author's data. Attachments are shown as links.</dd>
<dt><b>Encyclopedia</b>:</dt>
<dd>Like 'Full with Author' but attached images are shown inline.</dd>
<dt><b>FAQ</b>:</dt>
