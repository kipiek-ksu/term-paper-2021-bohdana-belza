<h1>Grades</h1>

<p>Many of the activities allow grades to be set.</p>

<p>By default, the results of all grades within the 
   course can be seen in the Grades page, available 
   from the main course page.</p>

<p>If a teacher is not interested in using grades in a 
   course, or just wants to hide grades from students, 
   then they can disable the display of grades in the 
   Course Settings.  This does not prevent individual 
   activities from using or setting grades, it just 
   disables the results being displayed to students.</p>
