List of nice to haves 
---------------------

- A way for modules to register the extent to which they support groups. Warn
people who try to set up groups with a module with legacy group support that it
might not work if more than one grouping exists. 
- A proper user interface for using the same groups in more than one course
- The option of view names by last name rather than first name. 
- Option of only showing students/teachers - having teachers mixed up with
students is confusing
- Maybe a nice way to see which users are in more than one group in a grouping?
- When adding users it would be nice to see the current users. 
- Think about metacourses and how groups relate to these 

Global groups - I want it to be possible to set up groupings for course 1 and 
for these to be visible for all course on the site, but not editable or 
deletable. I think this code should actually be quite easy to write now and I 
might even do it before this code is put in, just haven't done it yet.
# A nicer user interface (that doesn't break the back button :-) Ajax separates 
the back and front end of the code really well, so if anyone has good ideas on 
this, it should be quite easy for someone else to do without having to know how 
the internals of the groups code work.
# Integration with roles and permissions
# Sign up sheets for groups
# Proper support for blocks and global features.
# A way for modules and blocks to declare whether they support groups or not.
# Putting in search_users functionality for group permissions as well as just 
members of groups.
# Cool ways to set up groups automatically for particular pedagogical reasons - 
things like minimising overlap with groups in another grouping, creating groups 
just from the users all in another group and creating groups which merge pairs 
of groups from another grouping.
# Allow settings for groupings which restrict users from being in more than one 
group, number of people per group, etc.
