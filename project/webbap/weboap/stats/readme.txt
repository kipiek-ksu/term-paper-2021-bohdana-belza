The Statistics Plugging allows to generate qualitative and quantitative statistics in Moodle. 
It also allows to display the results on screen and/or as a written report.

The pluggin can only be run by the site administrator, to avoid security risks.

The text displayed on screen is only in English, so you are welcome to translate it in other l
anguages.

The way to install the pluggin is:


1) Create a folder called “stats” in the moodle directory of your moodle site.

2) Extract all the folders and file the former . 



4) Log into Moodle and run the index.php file , by typing
http://yourmoodlesite/stats/index.php
