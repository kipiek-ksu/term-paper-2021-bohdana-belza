<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Appointment</B></P>

<P>This type is used for signing up for an event.
You can set up a table of options (rows and columns) for the
student/teacher to choose from. There are several options that
govern how the table responds to a booking:
</p>

<P><B>Column names </B>
This field sets up how many columns the table will show.
You can use arbitary names, each name separated from the next by a comma.
You can optionally set a limit for the number of bookings for a given column
<br>Example:<br>
Option A:10,Option B,Option C:20
<br>will set up three columns, the first will have a limit of 10, the last a limit of 20.
There will be no limit for the second column.

<P><B>Row names </B>
The same as for column names.

<P><B>Who can edit</B>
Choose between Teachers and Students. Students means anyone in the course can make a booking.

<P><B>Exclusive</B>
Setting this to Rows will allow a student to make only one booking in each row.
Columns will limit to on booking pr user in each col.
Rows and Columns will do the same for both at once.
Single entry will only allow one booking pr user.
None will disable the exclusive tests, (you can still only have one booking pr user pr slot)

<P><B>Multiple</B>
If not set, then only one user can make a booking in each slot. If set then this is the
maximum number of users who can book into the same slot.
