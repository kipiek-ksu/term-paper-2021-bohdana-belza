PHP 4 and GD (Optional).

The GD library is available at http://www.boutell.com/gd/ and PHP is at
http://www.php.net/

Installation
------------
Put these files somewhere on your webserver, and point your browser to plot.php

Note: You can symlink "ln -s plot.php index.php" if you need to. If you 
have any problems running it, send an email to ivan@xpenguin.com

Configuration
-------------
All options can be edited in plotconf.inc. 

If you want to integrate IP-Atlas into your website, open up plot.php and
ip-atlas_prefs.php and edit the parts where it starts writing the html
(find for "<html>") and where it ends (</html>). You should replace theses
with your site template headers/footers.

You can create a new language file for IP-Atlas if you follow the directions
inside any language file in the languages/ directory.

If you create a new language file, please email it to ivan@xpenguin.com so 
it can be included in the next version.

1. The famous windows bug (also happens in other cirumstances)

If nothing appears when running the script on windows, open up plotconf.inc
and change the $trygd variable to "0".
