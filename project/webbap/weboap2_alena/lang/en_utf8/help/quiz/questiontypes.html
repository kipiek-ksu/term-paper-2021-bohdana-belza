<h1>Creating a new question</h1>

<p>You can add a variety of different types of questions to a category:</p>

<h2>Multiple Choice</h2>
<ul>
<p>In response to a question (that may include a image) the respondent 
   chooses from multiple answers.  There are two types of multiple choice
   questions - single answer and multiple answer.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Short Answer</h2>
<ul>
<p>In response to a question (that may include a image), the respondent 
   types a word or phrase.  There may several possible correct answers,

</ul>

<h2>Numerical</h2>
<ul>
<p>From the student perspective, a numerical question looks just
    like a short-answer question.
    The difference is that numerical answers are allowed
    to have an accepted error. This allows a continuous range of answers
    to be set.

<h2>True/False</h2>
<ul>

   selects from two options: True or False.

<h2>Matching</h2>

   respondent must "match" the correct answers with each question.

   has various answers embedded within it, including multiple choice, 
   short answers and numerical answers.

<h2>Random Short-Answer Matching</h2>

   in the current category.

<h2>Description</h2>
<ul>
<p>This is not a real question.  It simply prints some text (and possibly graphics)
   without requiring an answer.  This can be used to provide some information to 
   be used by a following group of questions, for example.
