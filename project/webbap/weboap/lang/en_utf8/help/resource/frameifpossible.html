<h1>Embedding files in a frame</h1>
<p>This option will allow the file to be displayed in a frame, so that the Moodle navigation remains on the page in an upper frame.</p>

<p>Note that this option is normally not necessary for media types such as movies, audio files and flash files, as without this option turned on they will be embedded within a navigable page.</p>

<p>Note also that the use of frames can break accessibility, and so this option will be completely ignored if the user has chosen the "Screenreader" option in their profile.</p>
