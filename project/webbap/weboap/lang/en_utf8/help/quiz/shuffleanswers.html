<h1>Shuffle answers</h1>

<p>If you enable this option, then the order of answers within 
   each question will be randomly shuffled each time a student 
   attempts this quiz.</p>

<p>Of course, this only applies to questions that have multiple 
   answers displayed, such as Multiple Choice or Matching Questions.</p>

<p>The intention is simply to make it a little harder for students 
   to copy from each other.</p>

<p>This option is not related to the use of Random Questions.</p>
