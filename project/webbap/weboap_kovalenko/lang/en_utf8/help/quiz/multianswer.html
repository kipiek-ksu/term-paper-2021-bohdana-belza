<h1>Embedded answers (Cloze)</h1>

<p>This very flexible question type is similar to a
   popular format known as the Cloze format.  </p>

<p>Questions consist of a passage of text (in Moodle format) that
   has various answers embedded within it, including multiple choice,
   short answers and numerical answers.</p>

<p>There is currently no graphical interface to create these questions -
   you need to specify the question format using the text box or by
   importing them from external files.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the input text used to specify such a question:</p>

<form action="">
<center>
<textarea rows="15" cols="60" wrap="virtual">This question consists of some text with an answer embedded right here {1:MULTICHOICE:Wrong answer#Feedback for this wrong answer~Another wrong answer#Feedback for the other wrong answer~=Correct answer#Feedback for correct answer~%50%Answer that gives half the credit#Feedback for half credit answer} and right after that you will have to deal with this short answer {1:SHORTANSWER:Wrong answer#Feedback for this wrong answer~=Correct answer#Feedback for correct answer~%50%Answer that gives half the credit#Feedback for half credit answer} and finally we have a floating point number {2:NUMERICAL:=23.8:0.1#Feedback for correct answer 23.8~%50%23.8:2#Feedback for half credit answer in the nearby region of the correct answer}.

Note that addresses like www.moodle.org and smileys :-) all work as normal:
 a) How good is this? {:MULTICHOICE:=Yes#Correct~No#We have a different opinion}
 b) What grade would you give it? {3:NUMERICAL:=3:2}

Good luck!
