<h3>Formal Blue</h3>
<hr />

<p>For this theme I modified the Formal White theme. See below to see how to modify the logo/header to suit your own needs.</p> 

<p>This theme has the colour gamma into the pale grey/brown area. Those colours
  renders in a very similar way in both RGB and LCD monitors. Custom logo can
  be easely substituded (see instruction below). Fonts used are &quot;Arial, Helvetica&quot;
  for text and menu items and &quot;Verdana,Geneva&quot; for headers, both  fonts are 
  fine for screen reading.</p>
<p>To update logos with your own: </p>
<ul>
  <li>create two file with two different sized logos: </li>
  <li>logo.jpg, height 150 pixel </li>
  <li>logo_small.jpg, height 50 pixel</li>
  <li>via FTP upload the jpg files into /moodle/theme/moodletwopointoh folder,
        overwriting the existing jpg.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  bigger logo will be used for the home page only, while the smaller will
  be used for all
the other pages. </p>
<p> I have included the .psd file to change the header/logo. If you want to change the text you will need to follow these steps.</p>
<p>First you will need to delete the <b>reflection</b> Layer. 
<p>Duplicate that text layer by pressing <b>Ctrl + J</b>. Drag the duplicated layer below your original in the Layers Palette. Right click on the duplicate layer in the palette and choose <b>Rasterize Type</b>.</p>
<p>With the duplicate layer chosen in the Layers Palette, press <b>Ctrl + T</b> to bring up the Free Transform. Right click in the transform binding box and choose <b>Flip Vertical</b>. Drag your flipped layer so that the bottoms match.</p>
<p>Add a Layer Mask by click on the button at the bottom of the Layers Palette or by going <b>Layer &gt; Layer Mask &gt; Reveal All</b>.</p>
<p>Press <b>D</b> to reset your colors and then press <b>G</b> to select the Gradient Tool. With the layer mask selected in the Layers Palette, which it should be already, drag from top-to-bottom with the Gradient Tool until you get the fade you desire.</p>
<p>This same technique will work for the <b>logo_small</p>.
