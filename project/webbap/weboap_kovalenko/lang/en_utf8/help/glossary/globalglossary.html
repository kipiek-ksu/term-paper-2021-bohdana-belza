<h1>Defining a global glossary</h1>

<p>Administrators can define a glossary to be global.</p>

<p>These glossaries can be part of any course (but particularly the front page).</p>

<p>The difference to a normal local glossary is that the entries are used to 
   create automatic links throughout the whole site (and not just in the same 
   course the glossary belongs to).</p>
