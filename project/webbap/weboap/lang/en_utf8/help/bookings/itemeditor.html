<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Item Editor</B></P>

<p>
With the item editor you can create or change items. Items (rooms/equipment) can be scheduled
if they have a property with the name <b>scheduled</b> and a value for this prop of
either weekly or yearly (at least so far).
Note: You must click save changes after each change in the item editor.
</p>

<P><B>Templates </B>
Each type of item can have an associated template item. Any fields defined in this
template will be available as default for all items of this type.
There are a few ready made templates:
<ul>
<li>room - weekly timetable schedule, default open for teachers.
<li>equipment - same schedule as for rooms, teachers only.
<li>student-equipment - as for equipment, but open for students.
<li>examroom - weekly schedule with multiple bookings.
<li>film - yearly schedule with bookings of one week each, only teachers can book.
<li>magazine - yearly schedule with bookings of one week each, students can book.
</ul>

<P><B>Item Types</B> 
You can create a new type by changing the text in childtype for any item.
There are a few predefined items with the childtype field already set.
Choose one of them and change childtype to the name of your new type.
Click on the link <b>Create child</b> (after saving changes) and you get a new child that you
can edit. Change the name of this item to xxxx_template where xxxx is the
new type. You can now reset the childtype to it's original value.
(click on the parent link to get back to the original item).

A note about yearly schedule:
If the item you choose yearly schedule for has any child items, then all these items will be
shown in the booking view. The parent will not be shown. Items with no children are scheduled 
directly as themselves.
