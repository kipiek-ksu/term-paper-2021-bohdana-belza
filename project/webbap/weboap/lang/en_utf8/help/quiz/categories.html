<h1>Question categories</h1>

<p>Rather than keeping all your questions in one big list,
   you can create categories to keep them in.</p>

<p>Each category consists of a name and a short description.</p>

<p>Each category can also be "published", which means
   that the category (and all questions in it) will be
   available to all courses on this server, so that
   other courses can use your questions in their quizzes.</p>

<p>Categories can also be created or deleted at will.
   However, if you try to delete a category containing
   questions, then you will be asked to specify another
   category to move them to.</p>

<p>You can also arrange the categories in a hierarchy so
   that they are easier to manage.  The 'Move category to'
   field lets you move a category to another category.</p>

<p>By clicking on the arrows in the 'Order' field, you
   can change the order in which the categories are listed.</p>
